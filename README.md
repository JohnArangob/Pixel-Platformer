# Cave Dwellers

## Description

You enter a dark cave in search of riches without knowing the dangers that await you there. As you cross the entrance the path collapses behind you and leaving you no choice but to continue forward, but the further you go the heavier the darkness becomes around you.

**As time passes the light from your lamp runs out, if you are left in total darkness you will have no escape.**
